Nothing too spectacular, just a very basic version of a thing.
Requires Python to run, and if you want to edit it I would recommend downloading PyCharm community edition as it will give error warnings and you can run the file directly from it to test it out.

For Python: just download the latest version

For PyCharm: make sure to check whether you're downloading the professional or community edition
